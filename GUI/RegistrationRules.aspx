			sexually-orientated or any other material, including links to pirated software or related to
			pirated software, that may violate any applicable laws. 
			Doing so may lead to you being immediately and permanently banned (and your service provider being 
			informed). The IP address of all people posting in forums on this forum system is logged to aid in
